    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as an interactive tutorial (and documentation) to **Remote Arrow**.\n",
    "More broadly it introduces you to **Apache Arrow**, specifically pyArrow and **Apache Arrow Flight**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Apache Arrow** is a language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Apache Arrow Flight** is a framework for high-speed transmission of Apache Arrow Tables over a network.  <br>\n",
    "It achieves that by eliminating the overhead for (de)serialization of the data, as well as allowing parallel down and uploads of data chunks.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**RemoteArrow** is a custom-framework built on top of Apache Arrow Flight and aims to solve the problem of redundancy <br>\n",
    "and performance bottlenecks when handling shared and large dataset by outsourcing them to a centralized remote server. <br>\n",
    "In other words, it tries to reduce the cost of data transmission, query, computation and storage of shared data for big data / ML applications. <br>\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this tutorial, we have examined how **Remote Arrow** can help to outsource the burden of computation, storage and shared access of data on a single server. <br>\n",
    "Though still in its prototype phase, it can offer tremendous flexibility for managing shared tabular data.<br>\n",
    "This effect becomes more evident when datasets are used in a network of heterogenous applications that work in different languages, <br>\n",
    "even more so when the shared data is extremely large and/or the clients low in computational prowess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect, we have not discussed in-depth yet is the remarkable boost in transmission speed, that has been benchmarked by *Ahmad et al.* [4]. <br>\n",
    "Their publication cites that *\"Flight is able to achieve up to **6000 MB/s and 4800 MB/s throughput**\"* <br>\n",
    "and companies like **Dremio** that use Arrow Flight **perform 20x and 30x better** compared to traditional connection methods. <br>\n",
    "That means Arrow Flight becomes an even better choice for applications that require long-haul communication over the internet. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the use-case, hopefully you have learned that **Arrow** especially in combination with **Arrow Flight** provides a highly performant framework for working with big data.\n"
